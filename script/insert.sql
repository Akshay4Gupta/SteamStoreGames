Units are selected and outfitted before going into battle with very limited reinforcement. Played over large scales to slow the pace down to give you time to react.<br><br>Every unit lost limits your options, but every enemy destroyed limits theirs. Plan ambushes and tactical manoeuvres to defeat forces larger than your own through well thought out choices instead of mechanical skill. Unlock more equipment to give your units diverse strategic and tactical options, or to specialise them for a given role. Inspired by the RTS, squad based tactics, and turn based tactics genres, this game focuses on the strategic and tactical choices that turn the tide of battle, while limiting the effectiveness of and need for micromanaging units. <br><br><strong>Accuracy and Damage</strong><br><br>By fighting on a large spatial scale, movement is slow, weapons have difficulty aiming, and bullet drop decreases damage, slowing down the pace of combat and increasing the Time-To-Kill. These three factors have complex systems which mean the size, speed, and distance to a target make it harder to hit, while the speed and accuracy of your own units affect their ability to hit a target. This affects not only whether they hit or miss, but how long it takes them to aim, and whether or not their weapon turrets can even turn fast enough to acquire the target.<br><br>This makes fighters harder to hit, close range units devastatingly powerful, and snipers deadly accurate.<br><br><strong>Movement</strong><br><br>There are four different movement types, giving units more variety than simply being slow or fast. Most units accelerate slowly, and bigger units accelerate even slower, which makes positioning important as changing positions takes time. Acceleration applies to both translation and rotation, allowing you to catch a battleship in its blind spot to deal damage to it before it can rotate to attack back. A fast unit might not have time to dodge an area attack if caught stationary, or it might take too long to change direction, while a slower, more agile unit might be better equipped to evade. Deceleration means that heavier units cannot simply stop at once, further impacting decisions based on range and area.<br><br><strong>Health</strong><br><br>With high health pools and bullet drop, units take a long time to be killed. This means you''re less likely to lose entire squads due to poor reaction time or forgetting about them in a mess of multitasking. It also gives you more time to decide to reposition them, give them cover, or change their abilities, state, or orders if you see the fight is not in your favour.<br><br>Health does not regenerate and healing is very rare and very slow. This means you cannot recklessly attack the enemy and fully recover from your lack of attention. Every point of health lost is a strategic consideration until that unit is destroyed, and when that unit is finally destroyed it (usually) cannot be replaced. Your force going into the fight is all you have, so careful unit selection and equipment is key to surviving. This changes the way the battle is fought, as every hit you deal to the enemy is a point in your favour, as is theirs.<br><br><strong>Planning</strong><br><br>Before most missions, players select which unit types and how many of each unit to use, and place them in a starting formation and direction. Unit weapons and armour can be selected for a given role such as anti-aircraft/anti-building/anti-ship, or to use a specific weapon type (laser/firearm/plasma/shell/etc.). Weapons are usually multipurpose and can serve multiple roles for flexibility while offering specific advantages as well.<br><br>More importantly, units can be fitted with special equipment: the Ambush equipment keeps a unit hidden until it moves or attacks enough for an enemy to detect them, the PAV propels units quickly to a designated location as long as it has fuel, the SL shield gives units a non-rechargeable shield to survive longer, and the beam rifle gives a unit a long range, high damage attack with slow reload.

insert into descriptionData values (E'443330', E'<h1>Fixed the bug in which the save data was in the same folder as Tokyo School Life''s save data.</h1><p>To restore your save data for Malus Code, please follow these steps:

1. Go to
C:\\Users\\(PC name)\\Documents\\M2\\
and backup the folder named “TSL”, and also the “MC” folder if it exists.

2. Make a duplicate copy of the previous save data folder:
C:\\Users\\(PC name)\\Documents\\M2\\TSL

3. Rename the copied folder to
C:\\Users\\(PC name)\\Documents\\M2\\MC
(If the MC folder already exists, please delete the existing folder before renaming.)


4. Start up Malus Code and continue playing as usual.

If you have previous save data from our other game, Tokyo School Life, the TSL save data may still be displayed in Malus Code. You can remove those saves by overwriting them, or just deleting them after following the above steps. The same applies to if Malus Code save data is displayed in Tokyo School Life.

Thanks for you playing, and we’re very sorry for the inconvenience caused by this bug.</p><br><h1>Patch Notes：　Malus Code Ver 1.02</h1><p>We enclosed a complete save file for Tokyo School Life in Malus Code Ver 1.02.

This is a save file for Tokyo School Life that unlocks all of the content in the Extra menu, meant for those who lost their data due to the bug in Malus Code Ver 1.00.

・ Do not use this save data for Malus Code.

・ You will overwrite TSL''s save data file (data_000_0000.bin), so please back it up in a safe location first.

1. Go to
C:\\Users\\(PCname)\\Documents\\M2\\TSL\\savedata

2. Rename the existing data as follows:

Rename
data_000_0000.bin
to
data_000_1111.bin

3. Locate the following file in the directory you installed Malus Code in (default path shown below):

C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Malus Code\\windata\\tsl_complete_savedata\\fdata_000_0000.bin

Copy fdata_000_0000.bin to the following folder:

C:\\Users\\(PCname)\\Documents\\M2\\TSL\\savedata

Then rename it to

data_000_0000.bin

4. Done!

Note: This will only effect the content in the Extra menu (music jukebox, gallery), so your save slot usage will remain the same as before.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>- Malus Code -
